# SimpleOscillator
Project for a super simple oscillator


*Note*: This project is just starting - issues and errors all over the place still. (Oct. 2019)

The goal of this project is to create a super simple oscillator that can be used for teaching basic electronics, basic DIY, and basic synthesis with low cost and low risk.
