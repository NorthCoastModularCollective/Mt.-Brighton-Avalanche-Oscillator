# Mt. Brighton Avalanche Oscillator
A super simple oscillator


The goal of this project is to create a super simple oscillator that can be used for teaching basic electronics, basic DIY, and basic synthesis with low cost and low risk. 

“Mt. Brighton Avalanche Oscillator” is a community developed and open-source kit designed specifically for learning. Its low part count, low complexity, and low cost is coupled with a transparency in design and function that makes it easier to understand and describe what is happening with the electricity and sound. When complete, you’ll have a simple, standalone battery operated synthesizer with a single knob for changing the pitch of the sound that you can plug headphones into, or other music gear.
